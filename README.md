# Array2Latex
This repo includes code that transforms an array into LaTeX script for creating a table in your paper. The purpose is to expedite the process of transfering your computational results into your publication. The first commit is just in Julia but I would love to expand this to other languages as well. As usual, comments, push requests and suggestions are welcome.
